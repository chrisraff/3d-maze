### How to run
This is a web program built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). You can't simply open the index.html page because loading the models would be a violation of the CORS policy. To get around this, you can simply host a local web server to serve the page. For example, you can host one with python 3.x by running `python -m http.server` from this repository's directory and then going to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
